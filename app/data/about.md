#### Intro
I am a software developer at [Faithlife](https://faithlife.com/about) where I write software for Logos, a desktop application for in-depth Bible study and e-reader platform. I am passionate about combining business acumen with technical prowess to create relevant solutions.
<br>
I am open to new opportunities in software development and particularly keen to work in web development.

Prior to working in software I was a management consultant at Deloitte. I primarily served large Fortune 500 clients, solving a myriad of problems ranging from market-entry strategy to mergers & acquisitions. However, my favorite projects were on small teams solving big problems, where my contribution was emphasized.
<br><br>
#### Currently
I work on the [Logos Desktop](https://www.logos.com/why-logos) platform for Windows and macOS. Our technology stack includes C# and Objective-C, with some JavaScript and React sprinkled in for web views. Prior to working on the desktop platform I worked on our free [mobile app](https://www.logos.com/mobile-app), primarily for Android but implemented a handful of features on iOS.

- I often try to make the numbers in an address equal to zero (e.g. 14126 => 1 x 4 x 1 + 2 - 6 == 0)
- I built this page off of an exisiting template created by [Michael D'Angelo](https://mldangelo.com/)

#### I dream of

- working on something bigger than myself.
- working with really smart people.
- mentoring and developing others.
- getting outside as often as I can
